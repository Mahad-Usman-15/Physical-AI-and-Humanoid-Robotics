# Introduction to Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics

This textbook provides a comprehensive introduction to the exciting and rapidly evolving fields of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. We will explore the fundamental concepts, technologies, and applications that are shaping the future of intelligent machines.

## What is Physical AI?

Physical AI refers to artificial intelligence systems that interact directly with the physical world. Unlike AI that operates solely in digital environments, Physical AI embodies intelligence in physical forms, such as robots, drones, and autonomous vehicles, allowing them to perceive, reason, and act in real-world scenarios.

## Why Humanoid Robotics?

Humanoid robots, designed to mimic the human form, represent a significant frontier in robotics. Their human-like structure and capabilities make them ideal for tasks in human-centric environments, from assistance in daily life to complex industrial operations.

## Structure of This Book

This book is divided into several modules, each focusing on a key aspect of Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. We will cover:

*   **ROS 2 Fundamentals**: The Robot Operating System 2, a powerful framework for robotic application development.
*   **Simulation**: Using tools like Gazebo and Unity to model and test robotic systems in virtual environments.
*   **Advanced Robotics with NVIDIA Isaac**: Leveraging NVIDIA's platform for high-performance robotics and AI.
*   **Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Systems**: Integrating visual perception, natural language understanding, and physical action.

## Getting Started

No prior experience in robotics or AI is strictly necessary, though a basic understanding of programming concepts will be beneficial. We encourage you to engage with the practical exercises and code examples provided throughout the book.
