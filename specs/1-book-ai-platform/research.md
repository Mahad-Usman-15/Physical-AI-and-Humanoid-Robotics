## Decision: Testing Frameworks

**What was chosen**: Jest for Docusaurus (frontend) and Pytest for FastAPI (backend).

**Rationale**: These frameworks are industry standards for their respective ecosystems, offering robust features for unit, integration, and end-to-end testing (when combined with other tools for E2E in a later phase if needed).

**Alternatives considered**: Cypress/Playwright for Docusaurus frontend and `unittest`/FastAPI TestClient for FastAPI backend. Jest and Pytest were chosen for their broader adoption and ecosystem support in this context, providing a solid foundation for comprehensive testing.
