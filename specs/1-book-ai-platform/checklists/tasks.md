# Task Quality Checklist: AI-Powered Book Platform

**Purpose**: Validate task list completeness and quality before proceeding to implementation
**Created**: 2025-12-04
**Feature**: specs/1-book-ai-platform/tasks.md

## Task List Quality

- [x] All user stories from spec.md are covered by tasks
- [x] Tasks are clear, specific, and actionable
- [x] Each task has a unique ID (e.g., T001, T002)
- [x] Task dependencies are clearly defined
- [x] Parallel opportunities are identified with [P]
- [x] Tasks reference specific file paths when applicable
- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain

## Testability & Traceability

- [x] Each user story has an independent test description
- [x] Tasks contribute directly to user story goals
- [x] Tasks are granular enough to be individually completable
- [x] Tasks avoid vague or ambiguous language

## Execution Readiness

- [x] Foundational tasks are clearly identified as blockers
- [x] Implementation strategy (MVP, incremental, parallel) is defined
- [x] All phases from the plan.md are represented
- [x] Tasks align with the overall project structure from plan.md

## Notes

- Items marked incomplete require task list updates before `/sp.implement`
