Act as a senior DevOps engineer.

Context:
- The FastAPI backend is already fully implemented.
- Only GitHub readiness and Railway deployment preparation are left.
- Frontend (Docusaurus) is already deployed on Vercel.
- Frontend URL for CORS must be exactly:
  https://physical-ai-and-humanoid-robotics-red.vercel.app/
- Backend will be deployed on Railway.


Task:
Inspect the existing backend codebase and apply only the minimal required changes so it can be pushed to GitHub and deployed successfully on Railway.
The frontend will also have some changes so also push that to the github.
Required Actions:

1. Railway Compatibility
- Ensure the FastAPI app starts using:
  uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port $PORT
- Do NOT hardcode any port.
- Ensure Python version compatibility (>=3.10).
- Do NOT introduce Docker.

2. Environment Variables
- Remove any hardcoded secrets.
- Ensure all secrets are read from environment variables only.



3. CORS (CRITICAL)
- Verify or update CORS configuration.
- Allow ONLY this origin:
  https://physical-ai-and-humanoid-robotics-red.vercel.app
- Allow credentials, all headers, and all methods.

4. requirements.txt
- Generate or fix `requirements.txt` so it includes all dependencies actually used by the backend.
- Ensure `fastapi` and `uvicorn[standard]` are present.

5. .gitignore
- Create or update `.gitignore` to include:
  .env
  .env.*
  __pycache__/
  *.pyc
  .venv/
  venv/
  .DS_Store
  .pytest_cache/
  .mypy_cache/




Rules:
- Do NOT refactor application logic.
- Do NOT change API contracts.


Output Format:
- The result must be ready to commit, push to GitHub, and deploy on Railway immediately.
