Revise and expand the existing spec.md so that it clearly separates the project into two phases. Phase 1 must focus exclusively on creating the textbook/book using Docusaurus v3 with no backend features implemented. Phase 2 will contain all backend, AI, RAG, authentication, and agent-skill functionality to be completed after Phase 1. Apply these rules while rewriting the specification: 1. Emphasize that Phase 1 (“Book Creation Phase”) is the only implementation target now. It must include: - Creating the root folder and the full Docusaurus v3 project. - Generating the docs/chapters structure for all required topics: Physical AI, Humanoid Robotics, ROS2, Gazebo, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA Robotics, Hardware Requirements, Cloud vs On-Prem Lab, and Hackathon Tasks. - Using Spec-Kit Plus directory automation. - Including minimal Docusaurus config, package.json, sidebar, and GitHub Pages deployment workflow. - Creating placeholder folders for backend, but NOT implementing any backend logic yet. - Reinforce FR-023: no backend implementation before the book is completed. 2. Move all backend features into Phase 2 (“Backend & Intelligence Layer”), including: - RAG chatbot, embeddings, Qdrant, NeonDB. - Better-Auth authentication. - User profile collection. - PersonalizerAgent, TranslatorAgent, BookGeneratorAgent, AuthAgent, DeploymentAgent. - Urdu translation logic. - Personalized chapter rewriting. - Chat sidebar widget. - FastAPI backend and deployment to Railway/Render. These must remain as future requirements, not part of Phase 1. 3. Reorganize User Stories: - Phase 1 user stories should cover reading chapters only. - All interaction, personalization, and AI stories must move to Phase 2. 4. Reorganize Functional Requirements: - Phase 1 FR list includes only Docusaurus structure, directory creation, config files, placeholders, deployment workflow, and chapter setup. - Backend-related FRs must be shifted to Phase 2. 5. Reorganize Success Criteria so that Phase 1 success is measured only by: - Correct Docusaurus v3 structure. - Correct directory and file generation. - Successful static build and GitHub Pages deployment. - No backend errors because backend is not implemented yet. 6. Produce a clean, well-organized, fully rewritten spec.md that strictly enforces this phase separation, keeps original technical detail, and is ready to be executed as a project blueprint. Do not provide summaries—output the complete updated specification.
