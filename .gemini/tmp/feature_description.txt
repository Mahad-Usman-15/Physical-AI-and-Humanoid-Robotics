You are an expert in Spec-Driven Development. Generate a complete, formal specification for building the RAG-based intelligent chatbot and interactive book features for my Docusaurus book project. Context: - I have built a book using Docusaurus.(in the physicalroboticbook) - Now I must add a fully integrated Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) chatbot using the OpenAI Agents/ChatKit SDKs, FastAPI backend, Neon Serverless Postgres, and Qdrant Cloud (Free Tier). - The chatbot must answer questions about: • the entire book • OR only the text selected by the user inside the chapter - The chatbot button should up the chatwindow and it should appear at the extremee right bottom The header should include sign in button and english and urdu selections buttons - The project must follow the functional requirements from requirement #6 to #22 from the file "1-book-ai-platform/specs" (assume you have access to their meaning). - Extra bonus: authenticate users using https://www.better-auth.com/, collect user background data on signup, and personalize content. - Extra bonus: Provide “Personalize Chapter” and “Translate Chapter to Urdu” buttons for authenticated users. Your task: Produce a thorough, precise SPECIFICATION defining: - all functional requirements (6–22 rewritten and expanded) - user journeys - system architecture - RAG architecture - data flow (Qdrant Cloud Free Tier + Postgres + FastAPI + client) - frontend–backend API contracts - authentication & personalization flow - integration inside Docusaurus (in the physicalroboticbook) - expected outputs, constraints, non-functional requirements The specification must be complete enough that developers who have never seen the repo could build the full system from it. Return your output as a highly structured, multi-section technical specification document. This specification 002-phased-implementation-spec.
