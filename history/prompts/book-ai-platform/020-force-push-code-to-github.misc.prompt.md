## Prompt

Now push this code to github https://github.com/Mahad-Usman-15/Physical-AI-and-Humanoid-Robotics.git ready to deploy the app

## Response snapshot

I have force pushed the local 'main' branch to the remote GitHub repository.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The code has been deployed to the remote GitHub repository, overwriting its previous content.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: No files were explicitly modified by this step, only pushed.
- 🔁 Next prompts: 
- 🧠 Reflection: Encountered "unrelated histories" error, network connectivity issue, and required explicit user confirmation for force push due to destructive nature.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: Network connectivity issue, git "unrelated histories" error, user hesitation for destructive operation.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): 
- Prompt variant (if applicable): 
- Next experiment:
