## Prompt

/sp.implement update the sidebar of my book by removing the tutorial basics and tutorial extras sections. Donot update any other section, donot create any new folder.

## Response snapshot

Updated the `physicalroboticbook/docusaurus.config.js` file to exclude `tutorial-basics` and `tutorial-extras` directories from the Docusaurus docs plugin. This action effectively removes these sections from the autogenerated sidebar, as per the user's request.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The Docusaurus sidebar now correctly excludes the specified tutorial sections, enhancing the navigation experience.
- 🧪 Tests: Configuration changes were applied, but no automated tests were run. Manual verification of the sidebar on the Docusaurus site is recommended.
- 📁 Files: Modified `physicalroboticbook/docusaurus.config.js`.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Continue with further implementation tasks or deployment.
- 🧠 Reflection: The `exclude` option in `docusaurus.config.js` was the most appropriate method to fulfill the user's request given the constraints, avoiding modification of `sidebars.js` or creating new files.
