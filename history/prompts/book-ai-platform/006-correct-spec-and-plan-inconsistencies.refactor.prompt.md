## Prompt

if you find any issues correct those

## Response snapshot

I have corrected all the issues found during the analysis. I have updated both the `plan.md` and `spec.md` files to be consistent with each other and with the project's constitution.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The `spec.md` and `plan.md` files are now consistent.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: `specs/1-book-ai-platform/spec.md` and `specs/1-book-ai-platform/plan.md` were updated.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Ready for the next command.
- 🧠 Reflection: The manual analysis and correction process was successful.
